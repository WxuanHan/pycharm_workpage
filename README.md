# RoboLab Autumn Template

Template for the RoboLab course in autumn which is conducted by the Systems Engineering Group at the Department of Computer Science, TU Dresden.

* Acts as a base repository for the final group assignment and the demonstration
* Provides scripts to speed up and automate the process of deploying as well as executing Python code on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robots running the customized, Debian based, operating system

## First steps

This repository is for the final task only which is done in groups of two.
Each group member has to provide one of the main files `hamming_code.py` or `stack_maching.py`.
Replace the already existing files.

After this, set up the connection with the LEGO brick (Wi-Fi or Cable), configure the `deploy-script` and execute everything for the first time.

## Help

Please consult the [RoboLab Docs](https://robolab.inf.tu-dresden.de/autumn). We provide extensive sections about this
template, our `deploy-script` and the programming interfaces.
